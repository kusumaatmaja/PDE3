    "# PDEs 3 Workshop 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first workshop of the PDE 3 (Numerical) course! \n",
    "\n",
    "### How the workshops will work:\n",
    "\n",
    "These workshops will give you a chance to put into practice the materials you have learnt in the lectures. You will have a two-hour workshop every two weeks and each will be in the format of a Jupyter Notebook like this one, allowing you to write and run code as well as give written answers in the same document. If you are unsure of how to use Jupyter Notebooks, take a look at the quickstart guide [here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or ask one of your demonstators for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the work we will complete in these workshops will use standard Python libraries such as `numpy` and `matplotlib`. Any modules that are required for an exercise will have been imported for you. You certainly should not need to try to install any modules yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are asked to write a Python function to complete a task, there may be a test cell below it which you can use to check your work. These will give comments to help you, incase you make any common mistakes. If your code passes these checks, you have likely implemented it correctly (though you should always check to make sure yourself too!).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** You may find it useful to turn on line numbers when you are debugging - you can do this by going to `View` > `Show Line Numbers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some questions will require you to do analytic work; you can either type your answers using [LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions) or write them by hand separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In this workshop:\n",
